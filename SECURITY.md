## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. Under the repository name, click  Security. If you cannot see the "Security" tab, select the  dropdown menu, and then click Security.
3. Click Report a vulnerability to open the advisory form.
4. Fill in the advisory details form.
5. At the bottom of the form, click Submit report. GitHub will display a message letting you know that maintainers have been notified and that you have a pending credit for this security advisory.
6. Optionally, click Start a temporary private fork if you want to start to fix the issue. Note that only the repository maintainer can merge changes from that private fork into the parent repository.
